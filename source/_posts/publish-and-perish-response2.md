_This piece is a response to Reinhard's [Publish and Perish](/2017/05/04/publish-and-perish/)_

Academia sometimes feels like a game. Not a very good game, mind you; the rules don’t make much sense, and whatever ends up separating the winners from the losers (so many, many losers) seldom seems to correlate with the ways in which people play. Academic publishing is a particularly guilty culprit, with its endless parade of painful rewrites, arbitrary delays and assorted catastrophes on the road to, at best, dozens and dozens of readers. It is enough to drive anyone to despair — if they take the game too seriously. Better to cultivate a healthy detachment from the whole mess and to take solace in the only part of the game that one can really control: the process of writing itself.

At least, that is the message that I have read — or, possibly, that I have chosen to read — into _Publish and Perish_, Andrew Reinhard’s whimsical but devilishly effective piece of interactive fiction published elsewhere in this issue. Sending this message may not have been the author’s intention at all. But like all good works of art, _Publish and Perish_ seeds thoughts and feelings of its own. And a good piece of interactive art, it most definitely is.

Structurally, _Publish and Perish_ walks in the footsteps of the ReadySoft classic _Dragon’s Lair_ and of its (much less classic) followup _Brain Dead 13_. A single, more or less random path through a complex network of choices leads to ultimate success. Any deviation from that path quickly results in the player’s demise, either from the shame of failure or from laugh-out-loud encounters with such improbable threats as ironic runaway vegetation and homicidal reviewers. (Exactly how improbable is open for debate; we have all wondered about Reviewer 2 once or twice, haven’t we?)

This simple architecture probably disqualifies _Publish and Perish_ from being called a ‘game’ in the modern sense, at least if one follows the definition proposed by Sid Meier, of _Civilization_ fame, [of a game as a series of interesting choices](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/164869/GDC_2012_Sid_Meier_on_how_to_see_games_as_sets_of_interesting_decisions.php). After all, a choice can hardly be called interesting if most options lead to absurd disasters through no clear chains of causality.

However, by advertising to the player ahead of time that death is _inevitable_ in _Publish and Perish_, Reinhard achieves two worthy goals. First, he devalues success and therefore defuses any frustration born of frequent failure. Second, by removing the incentive to stop playing after finding the optimal path, he intentionally transforms the work into what _Dragon’s Lair_ ended up becoming by accident: an exercise in metagaming in which the goal is no longer to win but to explore as many fail states as possible. Thus detached from the outcome, the player is able to accept the academic publishing world as irretrievably chaotic and to let go of any desire for control _because success and failure no longer seem to matter very much_. The result is a feeling of comfortable doom not unlike the one produced by listening to a long Leonard Cohen playlist. Meanwhile, the rare quiescent and happy game states are those in which the player’s avatar is in charge of their own creative process. Within _Publish and Perish_’s worldview, the need for external validation through publishing success, ostensibly the goal that the player is expected to achieve, is therefore subtly replaced by more attainable internal motivations. Clever, indeed.

Of course, in the real world, such a solipsistic, vaguely nihilistic, tending-one’s-own-garden strategy is unlikely to lead to fame and glory. But, and that is the whole point of _Publish and Perish_, neither is playing by the rules. In the academy, there are no winning strategies. Doing one’s best is a necessary, but by no means a sufficient, condition for victory. This trip’s destination is unknowable. One might as well try to enjoy the journey.
