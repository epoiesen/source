Dear Dr. Dal Borgo,

My name is Shawn Graham, and I'm the editor of an experiment in creative engagement in history and archaeology called 'Epoiesen'. (http://epoiesen.library.carleton.ca). I've received a submission from Neville Morley where he turns Thucydides' Melian Dialogue into a game. While gamification and game-theory are not quite the same thing, I wondered if you might find it intriguing enough to consider being a Respondent on the piece?

What this entails: Epoiesen publishes what might be called ‘paradata’, the discussion of the why and how of creative engagements with the past – games, art, and so on. Rather than anonymous peer review, we have ‘Responding to…’ pieces where instead of finding the flaws, or acting as a gatekeeper, we encourage you to start a discussion. Some of our Responses have been in the form of personal essays about how the work has moved the Respondent; others have been more formal considering the work in the context of broader trends. One takes the form of a game itself, while another is a series of annotations on the original text. If you browse the site more generally, you’ll see how various folks have approached the problem of responses. All responses receive form digital object identifiers and are published as well.

Professor Morley's discussion piece may be viewed at https://epoiesen.library.carleton.ca/2019/02/06/the-melian-dilemma-remaking-thucydides/

I would be delighted to chat with you about what a Response could look like. Alternatively, I appreciate that everyone's time and energy is limited, and would appreciate suggestions of other scholars who might be game.

Best wishes,
Shawn
